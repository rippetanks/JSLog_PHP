### Getting Started

The repository contains two files that implement a backend using mysqli (objects and procedural). *JLog.php* is a lib that uses PDO to connect to the database, the *test_lib* and *test_profile* files use this lib. There is also an html file to perform tests and a database dump (MariaDB).
